  "ModalText": "Organic production in Ukraine plays a key role in creating a healthy and environmentally friendly food chain. Their activities focus on growing food without the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, using natural methods of soil cultivation. Organic production practices include the preservation of biodiversity, the use of renewable resources, and the prohibition of genetically modified organisms. Organic producers also take care of the welfare of animals, giving them space to express themselves naturally and eliminating the use of antibiotics and artificial growth stimulants. Leading organic producers in Ukraine demonstrate their commitment to sustainable agriculture and provide consumers with the opportunity to choose organic and natural products. Their activities contribute to the development of local farms, improve consumer health and preserve the environment."
